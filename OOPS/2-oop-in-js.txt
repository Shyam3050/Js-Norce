OOP in javascript
 
Note: javascript have different than classical Opps  
 
In javasscript we have prototypes 
all objects in js linked to a prototype object
prototype: 
            prototype is a special object which is present on classes (classical classes/ blue print).
 When we create objects from those classes prototype property added as a property of that created object.
(this is called prototype inheritances).

// prototype inheritence is not same oops inheritence there one class inheritence form anoter class those are both classes ( classical classes which is blueprint)
// in prototype inheritence instences(objects)  ( mean objects are created from classes which is blueprint ) are access the methods from its parent class.

Prototype Inheritance: 
the prototype contains methods and variable that are accesible to all objects linked to that prototype.

All the methods are copied from class to all instances.

EXAMPLE:  
             Const num = [1,2,3];
             num.map(v => v * 2);
            
 like in mdn web Array.prototype.map();
Basically Array Is Constructor function which have Prototype object
When we create array then we access those prototype methods.
 


  HOW DO WE ACTUALLY CREATE PROTOTYYPES? AND HOW WE LINK TO PROTOTUPES? HOW CAN WE CREATE NEW OBJECTS WITH OUT HAVING CLASSES?
  
   1- CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 
     Technique to create objects from a function
     this is how built-in objects like Arrays,Maps, Sets are actually implemented.
   
   2- ES6 CLASSES
     this is not a classical classes.  
     Modern alternative to constuctor function
     Es6 not behave like classes in classical oops
     behind the scene Es6 implemented constuctor function
   
   3- Objects.Create() 
     this is the easiest one to linking an objects to a prototype object.

   ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE, POLYMORPHISIM
