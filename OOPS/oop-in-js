OOP in javascript
 
Note: javascript have different than classical Opps  
 
In javasscript we have prototypes 
all objects in js linked to a prototype object

Prototype Inheritance: 
the prototype contains methods and variable that are accesible to all objects linked to that prototype.

  HOW DO WE ACTUALLY CREATE PROTOTYYPES? AND HOW WE LINK TO PROTOTUPES? HOW CAN WE CREATE NEW OBJECTS WITH OUT HAVING CLASSES?
  
   1- CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 
     Technique to create objects from a function
     this is how built-in objects like Arrays,Maps, Sets are actually implemented.
   
   2- ES6 CLASSES
     Modern alternative to constuctor function
     Es6 not behave like classes in classical oops
   
   3- Objects.Create() 
     this is the easiest one to linking an objects to a prototype object.
     
 
  4 pillar of javascript
   ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE, POLYMORPHISIM
